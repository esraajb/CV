## Projects
### [Near miss](https://berkely-homes-interventions.herokuapp.com/)
A mobile first built application. Focused mainly on the front end.
Worked with React, Redux and Tachyons. Tested with Tape and Enzyme.

### [Isomorphic Javascript Application](https://github.com/esraajb/IsoJSapp)
Built the whole application. Used React on the Front-end, Express on the Back-end.
This application is special because I am rendering react from the server using Express and React-router.

A platform for writing and sharing reviews of coding resources.
Were a member in a team of four developers. we wrote the whole code while pair-programming.
Used Hapi on the server side, Postgres(with Login authentication) as our Database, and Handlebars for the views.

### [SDM-APP](https://cypiapt-lndse.github.io/sdm-app/)
A prototype built for Anna Freud Center which encourages clinicians and patients to make a shared decision about the treatment that the patient will receive.
